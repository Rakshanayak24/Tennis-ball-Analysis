# Tennis Ball Analysis

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

This project analyzes **tennis ball performance and movement** using computer vision and data analysis techniques. It tracks ball trajectories, calculates speed, spin, and impact points, and visualizes patterns through interactive plots and heatmaps. The analysis helps improve player performance and game strategies.

## Features
- Track ball trajectory from video frames
- Calculate speed, spin, and impact points
- Visualize movement patterns with charts and heatmaps
- Generate actionable insights for players and coaches

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennis-ball-analysis.git
cd tennis-ball-analysis
